            U-M-Commuter was my final project for my Interaction Design course
            at the University of Michigan. It is a basic app to help students
            commute to college campuses easier by providing them with more
            information, such as the availability of parking in student lots. It
            is a simple idea that to help student commuters, and there is no
            reason that the information should not be available.

            The prototype for the app also includes a student rideshare/carpool
            system to help students save on the cost of an expensive parking
            pas, reduce emissions, and help students connect. I created the
            prototype entirely in Figma, and it was my first ever prototype. The
            complete prototype can be viewed

            As part of my Contextual Inquiry class at the University of Michigan
            I was paired with a group assigned to conduct UX Research on behalf
            of the University of Michigan, which had requested a group to assist
            with an internal issue.

            My group conducted employee interviews to gather data and then
            analyzed it using affinity notes that we organized with an affinity
            wall. Our findings and recommendation were then presented to the
            Michigan Theater in our collaborative report (available upon
            request) and a stakeholder presentation.

            I'm a nerd. I started out playing Diablo and Starcraft when I was a
            small child. Growing up I spent my free time playing WoW, Dungeons

            Lord of the Rings for the millionth time.
